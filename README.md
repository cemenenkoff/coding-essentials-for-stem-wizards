# Zero to Hero: Learning to Code with Math

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
When I graduated in math and physics, I had some Python experience, but only in a research context. I needed to shift my thinking to a more computational approach. I realized that strong software skills could help solve complex problems. I found [Project Euler](projecteuler.net), a website focused on solving progressively challenging math problems solved with code, and thought it was the perfect place to start.

## 1.2 Purpose
After six years as a professional developer, I've added the tools, tips, and tutorials I wish I'd had when I started. If you're strong in math but need to improve your Python skills, this repository is for you.

# 2. Environment Setup
If you've ever played with R or Python in a research context, you may have used a tool like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to streamline the process of getting set up, installing pacakages that all play nice with each other, and getting down to writing some poorly-optimized prototype code. Staying in this tutorial zone will eventually hold you back, and even though it may be frustrating at first, learning to set up Python and interface with your computer's filesystem is important foundational knowledge.
